### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Idong!

Since January â€˜20 Iâ€™ve gained 12+ months of full-time, remote, experience developing landing pages, creating single page React applications, building back-ends, making network requests to APIs, traversing binary trees, and working in cross functional teams of 6+ engineers - including front and back-end devs, data science devs, and team leads. I can say with pride that I've come so far! Excited to both continue learning and to see what lies ahead on my journey to landing my first Software Engineering position!

### Folow me ...
