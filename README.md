### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Idong!
A recent grad from Bloom Tech's Software Engineering curriculum in which I gained experience in;
- Front-end technologies - HTML5, CSS3(LESS, SASS), Styled Components, JavaScript, React(.js), and Redux
- Back-end technologies - Node(.js), Python, Express(.js), SQL and basic Assembly Language 
- And participated in several cross-functional teams of up to 7 engineers including; front-end developers, back-end developers, data scientists, and team leads

Since completing the program I've kept current by taking advantage of a full-stack web development course on Udemy and freeCodeCamp. I'm excited to be a part of the tech community and a lifetime learner of programming languages and their various frameworks as well as other development technologies!

I am open to work so feel free to contact me about collaborating or career opportunities!
